So, generally Mac comes with basic and boring terminal(zsh).\nFor a long time I didn’t know the power we can leverage using zsh. I looked in to youtube for terminal setup found few amazing tutorials to make my terminal flexible as well as aesthetic.\nAlmost all of the tutorials explained the same thing:\nInstalling Iterm2 and oh my zsh framework A powerlevel10k theme A nerd font ( I use jetbrains mono) Configure .zshrc file to my own needs such as auto completions \u0026amp; few aliases…. Then I made my terminal mildly transparent to make it look more charming.\nSo, since I’m addicted to aesthetics of my terminal I wanted learn vim so that I can stick with it while coding and jotting down ideas.\nInitially it seemed worthless effort. But after few weeks of “trying and leaving”, one fine day I determined to learn vim. The basic idea here is you should be able to finish your entire time in vim without lifting your fingers on your keyboard. I wanted to list out the commands that I use, but it’s pretty useless, you can find better documentation here.\nApart from using :vsp to vertically split screen to compare 2 files at the same time, I configured (aliased) few plugins that I use often. To access nerdtree press F1, you can toggle using ctrl+w or you can also use mouse. If you add #!/usr/bin/env python3 at the beginning of python file you can click F2 to run it or else you should run with :! command.\nI recently need to download my telegram chat history. When I’ve downloaded it gave me all these html files. But I really don’t wanna store every file. I want one single html file with all the data. So run a python command to get me the names as I desired. Then I use cat command on my mac terminal to concatenate all the files.\nI also use tmux as terminal emulator to run multiple sessions parallelly.\nabbreviations or aliases\nI’ve learnt basics of bash scripting and it’s quite fun to use in actual life. It’s just automating stuff that you would do with your terminal. Let’s say you have to run few commands at once to perform certain task.\nNot only that homebrew has so many fun once cmatrix, tetris, toilet,…\nhistory brew open google autocompletion…pluggins cmatrix neofetch leave say -V tessa\n","date":"2022-03-06T00:00:00Z","image":"http://localhost:1313/p/zsh/cover_hud7e36f7e20e71be184458283bdae4646_55974_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/zsh/","title":"My Zsh"},{"content":"","date":"2024-07-30T22:41:27+05:30","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/vim/","title":"Vim"}]
